Working towards an inclusive web helps us achieve that goal.</p><p class="mb-8">In this article I’ll share my thoughts on why accessibility is important; from empathy and what is simply “good business”, through to selfishness and accessibility laws.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">International Day of Persons with Disabilities
</h3><p class="mb-8">The publication date of this article is no accident: December 3rd is the United Nations’ <!-- -->. Today we’d like to raise awareness and demonstrate what we can do with inclusive web design.</p>What is Web Accessibility?<p class="mb-8">When we talk about web accessibility we often start by defining it. I’d like to start with quote:</p>“Would you build a bridge that only a specific type of car can use?” – <p class="mb-8">Let that sink in for a while. I can’t think of better way to summarize the inclusive web (and I suggest you read all <!-- --> after this one).</p><p class="mb-8">In other words, everyone should be able to browse, navigate, and interact with the web using any device they might have.</p><p class="mb-8">Note that I haven’t yet mentioned users with disabilities. It’s true that different types of disabilities play a big role in web accessibility, but everybody can have special needs. We are all different and our needs can change over time. Let’s look at some examples of diversity.</p>Accessibility is About You and Me<p class="mb-8">Many things can affect how we use the web. Here are a couple of mini-stories about different kinds of people and how they might struggle using the web.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">My Parents, Age 74</h3><p class="mb-8">My parents’ eyesight isn’t that great anymore. Both have worn glasses for years, but that’s not the only problem. The real issue is their crappy old monitor. With their eyesight it’s impossible to see text if there isn’t enough contrast between background and text color.</p><p class="mb-8">They also struggle to use more complex sites or fill out the forms. This may be because websites and forms can be too complex, but they definitely want to use online services just like me.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Usher Syndrome</h3><p class="mb-8">My friend’s wife has <!-- -->, type three. She has narrow sight, which means that “busy” sites are problematic for her. She finds it difficult to navigate and locate the actual content when there is lots happening on the page. For her needs, the simpler the better.</p><p class="mb-8">Good color contrast helps significantly when reading the text and underlining the links helps identify them within text.</p><p class="mb-8">Form submit buttons are difficult to find if they only have thin borders with a transparent background, and the same goes with form fields if they don’t have clear separation from the background.</p><p class="mb-8">She also informs me that ads in amongst the content are confusing. I couldn’t agree more.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Injury in an Accident</h3><p class="mb-8">A couple of years ago my friend was in a car accident and broke bones in both his hands. For a guitar player it was a shock. But almost as big a shock was in realizing he would struggle to use his laptop and phone while recovering from the accident.</p><p class="mb-8">He started to use keyboard commands on his laptop, and voice commands on his smartphone. However, many websites he wanted to use were not accessible via the keyboard only. Even small tasks could take hours.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Student With Low Vision</h3><p class="mb-8">My first personal experience of accessibility was a student of mine who had a low vision. She wasn’t completely blind, but she had to use a magnifier to read. </p><p class="mb-8">She also used a screen reader for navigating the web, but most sites were easier to use with her magic magnifier. </p><p class="mb-8">But she came to terms with the barriers. “I’m just going to find another, better website”, she often noted.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Students Who Have Difficulty Reading</h3><p class="mb-8">I don’t teach languages (I teach math) but I often talk to teachers who do. Students can experience difficulties reading and understanding text for several reasons:</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Color Blindness</h3><p class="mb-8">It’s almost certain that some of my friends are color blind. Heck, even I could have some sort of color blindness. <!-- -->.</p><p class="mb-8">Imagine that links are not underlined in your main content, but instead rely on a different color. How would you distinguish them if you experienced some kind of color blindness?</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">No Captions on Video, no Transcript on Audio</h3><p class="mb-8">It should go without saying that people who are deaf, or hard of hearing, benefit from captions on video, or a transcript of audio. But how many times have you also needed captions?</p>Diversity of People<p class="mb-8">From all these examples you will have noticed real diversity of people and situations, yet still they share many of the same issues. Sometimes accessibility issues are:</p><p class="mb-8">If empathy for these situations hasn’t yet convinced you, there are other concrete reasons why inclusive web design is important.</p>Inclusive Web Design is Good for Business<p class="mb-8">As a business owner would you like to exclude potential clients using your product? I hope not. Here are some numbers off the top of my head:</p><p class="mb-8">According to Jonathan Hassell’s book <!-- -->, these estimates are pretty accurate. He uses the United Kingdom as an example.</p>Accessibility is Good for Usability<p class="mb-8">Usability and accessibility walk hand in hand and both share the same goal: that the website or app is easy to use for everyone.</p><p class="mb-8">I like these <!-- -->:</p><p class="mb-8">These are perfectly aligned with accessibility and inclusive web design ideas.</p>Accessibility is Good for SEO<p class="mb-8">Search engines are blind. You’ll therefore find some overlapping in SEO and accessibility:</p><p class="mb-8"> has a valid point in that SEO use cases account for only a small fraction of accessibility. It’s true that accessibility doesn’t lead to better SEO automatically, but even the small fraction of overlapping is good to keep in mind.</p>Accessibility is Required by Law<p class="mb-8">Are you still not convinced about accessibility being a natural part of web and digital products? Would you hop on board if creating accessible websites and digital products were required by law?</p><p class="mb-8">Well, it is required by law in many countries. I don’t know about your country (please leave a comment and let us know) but in the European Union (EU) there is <!-- -->. It was approved on 22 December, 2016.</p><p class="mb-8">Note that this directive addresses public sector websites specifically. But don’t let that detail deter you. You can include accessibility in all your work.</p><p class="mb-8">E.U. member states have a few years to put this legislation in place, but it must be implemented before 23 September, 2018. In Finland this means the following kind of schedule:</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Accessibility Laws in Europe</h3><p class="mb-8">There are four main points mentioned in the directive which explain how to build more accessible digital services. They must be:</p><p class="mb-8">To be honest I don’t fully understand what those mean exactly–it seems there’s room for interpretation. But I do understand that these rules are inline with <!-- --> (WCAG). For more information on WCAG here are some useful resources:</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Accessibility Laws in the U.S. and Other Countries</h3><p class="mb-8">In the <!-- -->. Paciello Group have a good overview of <!-- -->.</p><p class="mb-8">I encourage you to find out what accessibility laws your country have.</p>Accessibility is a Team Effort<p class="mb-8">I think I heard something? Was it a sound of your mental switch:</p>“Hey, let’s build that bridge for everyone. Not just for our Ferraris”.<p class="mb-8">The people of the world would like that very much. But this is not a one person show; it needs everybody in your company or organization to get involved.</p><p class="mb-8">Accessibility is a shift in mindset of your entire company. It’s not just a checklist for what you have to do within your role. In an ideal world we would all want to build a usable, accessible, inclusive, and better web for <em>everyone</em>.</p></div></div><div class="text-center mt-20 mb-8 p-12 relative rounded-lg bg-black bg-opacity-20"><div class="absolute left-0 right-0 -top-14"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"><img style="display:block;max-width:100%;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0" alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMTAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwMCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjEiLz4="/></span><img alt="Sami Keijonen" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="align-middle rounded-full" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Sami Keijonen" src="https://media.graphcms.com/Lbf71PmNRnt9KIgYbx2S" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" class="align-middle rounded-full" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span></div><h3 class="text-white my-4 text-xl font-bold">Sami Keijonen</h3><p class="text-white text-lg"></p></div><div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-8 pb-12 mb-8"><h3 class="text-xl mb-8 font-semibold border-b pb-4">Leave a comment</h3><div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 mb-4"><textarea class="p-4 outline-none w-full rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-gray-700" placeholder="Comment..." name="comment"></textarea></div><div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mb-4"><input type="text" class="py-2 px-4 outline-none w-full rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-gray-700" placeholder="Name?" name="name"/><input type="text" class="py-2 px-4 outline-none w-full rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-200 bg-gray-100 text-gray-700" placeholder="Email?" name="email"/></div><div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 mb-4"><div><input type="checkbox" id="storeData" name="storeData" value="true"/><label class="text-gray-500 cursor-pointer ml-2" for="storeData">: Save e-email and name for next comment.</label></div></div><div class="mt-8"><button type="button" class="transition duration-500 ease hover:bg-indigo-900 inline-block bg-pink-600 text-lg rounded-full text-white px-8 py-3 cursor-pointer"> Post Comment</button></div></div><div></div></div><div class="col-span-1 lg:col-span-4"><div class="relative lg:sticky top-8"><div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-8 mb-8"><h3 class="text-xl mb-8 font-semibold border-b pb-4 ">Related posts</h3></div><div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-8 mb-8"><h3 class="text-xl mb-8 font-semibold border-b pb-4 ">Categories</h3></div></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Building an Inclusive Web: Why Accessibility Matters","excerpt":"In this article I’ll share my point of view about why accessibility is important; from empathy and what is simply “good business”, through to selfishness.","featuredImage":{"url":"https://media.graphcms.com/iq8n35JSGa8L11LyxSvc"},"author":{"name":"Sami Keijonen","bio":null,"photo":{"url":"https://media.graphcms.com/Lbf71PmNRnt9KIgYbx2S"}},"createdAt":"2021-11-27T12:13:42.570687+00:00","slug":"webaccess","content":{"raw":{"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Accessibility matters because we, the people, want to use the web.
